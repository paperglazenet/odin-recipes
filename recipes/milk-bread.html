    <p> This Asian milk bread recipe is a triumph. I’m not
         exaggerating when I tell you that for months, we’ve 
         searched, tested, and failed time and time again 
         to nail down a perfect recipe for soft, buttery, 
         fluffy milk bread. Until that is, when we finally 
         did it!</p>
    <p> Milk bread is an Asian style of soft, buttery, and 
        slightly sweet bread. There are variations in Japan 
        (where it’s known as shokupan) as well as China. 
        In Chinese bakeries, you’ll find milk bread in 
        various forms: loaves, sliced, pull-apart buns, and 
        as the basis for a wide variety of Hong Kong Style 
        bakery buns.</p>

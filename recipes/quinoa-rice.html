    <p> This quinoa rice mix is a great way to get the enjoyment of eating steamed white rice with your stir-fries and other dishes—but with the high-protein and fiber rich addition of quinoa! </p>
    <p> We do a 50/50 mix here. However, you can up the amount of quinoa for more fiber, protein, and nutrients, or ease into things with a greater proportion of jasmine rice. If you’re trying to cut down on your consumption of refined starches, but aren’t ready to transition wholeheartedly to brown or black rice, this recipe is for you! </p>
   
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup quinoa</li>
        <li>1 cup jasmine rice</li>
        <li>2 cups water </li>
    </ul>

    <h3> Steps </h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Toast the quinoa in a dry pan over medium-high heat for 5-8 minutes, or until it is a couple of shades darker and you start to hear a light crackling/popping sound.</li>
        <li>If using a rice cooker, transfer the quinoa and rice to your rice cooker pot. Add 2 cups water (i.e. an equal volume of water to quinoa and rice. You can also just use the fill lines in the rice cooker, and the cup it came with). Start the rice cooker, and walk away until it’s done!</li>
        <li>When the grains are fluffy and cooked through, fluff with a rice paddle and serve!</li>
    </ol>
